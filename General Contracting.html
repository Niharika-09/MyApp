                    Like the five blind men encountering different parts of an elephant, each of the numerous participants in
                     the process of planning, designing, financing, constructing and operating physical facilities has a different
                      perspective on project management for construction. Specialized knowledge can be very beneficial, 
                      particularly in large and complicated projects, since experts in various specialties can provide valuable 
                      services. However, it is advantageous to understand how the different parts of the process fit together. 
                      Waste, excessive cost and delays can result from poor coordination and communication among specialists.
                      It is particularly in the interest of owners to insure that such problems do not occur. And it behooves 
                      all participants in the process to heed the interests of owners because, in the end, it is the owners who
                      provide the resources and call the shots.
